The classes you can skip can be calculated by :
(4*(Classes attended) - 3*(Total classes))/3
The result is floored to integer value. Also, for lab slots, the result is divided by 2 as 1 class in lab is two classes

The classes you need to attend can be calculated by:
3*(Total Classes) - 4*(classes attended)

The data is scraped from FFCS site using specific url for the day programmed is run.
This script doesn't check whether future classes will be held or not.
